This set of Matlab (7.0) functions contain the core code for generating 
Fig.2 and Figs.4(a,b) of the following paper:

"Bayesian Compressive Sensing" 
Shihao Ji, Ya Xue, and Lawrence Carin, IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, vol. 56, no. 6, June 2008.

and Fig.2 and Fig.3 of the following paper:

"Multi-Task Compressive Sensing" 
Shihao Ji, David Dunson, and Lawrence Carin, IEEE Trans. Signal Processing (Accepted), 2008.

--------
BCS_demo
--------
1) Fig2.m ---> generate Fig.2
     The following two Matlab files from l1-magic are required for BP implementation:
     l1qc_logbarrier.m
     l1qc_newton.m
     which can be found at: http://www.acm.caltech.edu/l1magic/

2) Fig4_ab.m ---> generate Figs.4(a,b)
     multi_random_measures.m     ----> generate the "Random" curve for Fig.4a
     multi_optimized_measures.m  ----> generate the "Optimized" curve for Fig.4a
     multi_approx_measures.m     ----> generate the "Approx." curve for Fig.4a

----------
MT_CS_demo
----------
***A bug was fixed on Aug. 03, 2008 in MT_CS.m for the cases where signals are dramatic undersampled.***
1) Fig2.m ---> generate Fig.2

2) Fig3.m ---> generate Fig.3
     multi_runs_75.m     ----> generate the "MT 75%" curve for Fig.3
     multi_runs_50.m     ----> generate the "MT 50%" curve for Fig.3
     multi_runs_25.m     ----> generate the "MT 25%" curve for Fig.3


The code is still in development stage. If you have any comments or bug reports, 
you are welcome to contact Shihao Ji at shji@ece.duke.edu.
